Welcome to the MyPath project. The purpose of this project is to build an accessible routing and navigation system for wheelchair users to get to their destination from any source location. We determine accessible routes by classifying surfaces from vibration data. In existing mapping systems, the developers rarely consider the experience of the persons with disabilities in most cases. For example, wheelchair users may encounter steep slopes or other barriers in the built environment which they cannot overcome, or uneven road surfaces and broken sidewalks that are not suitable for wheeled navigation. In order to solve this problem and improve the user experience, we proposed the MyPath solution. We analyze and classify the data collected by sensors and then using the ML model to predict any new surface data available during the testing phase of the system. The road surface information is then updated in a research-oriented open-source mapping system known as the OpenStreetMap (OSM). Finally, we combine the userâ€™s personalized requirements and the accessibility of each road to generate an accessible route for wheelchair users through the use of Graphhopper API which is a dedicated routing engine for the OSM.

# Project Setup Documentation

This README outlines the necessary steps to set up and run the mobile application project. It includes instructions for cloning the project, installing dependencies, and running the application.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system before proceeding:
- Node.js and npm
- Yarn (optional, for iOS)
- Cocoapods (for iOS)
- Android Studio or Xcode (for running simulators)

## Setting Up the Project

### Cloning the Repository
1. Clone the project from the repository to your local machine.

### Navigating to the Project Directory
2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MyPathApp

### Installing Node Modules
3. Install the required Node modules:
    ```bash
    npm install

### Preparing iOS Environment
4. Navigate to the iOS directory:
    ```bash
    cd ios

5. Install iOS libraries using Yarn or Pod:
    ```bash
    yarn install # or pod install

6. Return to the project home directory:
    ```bash
    cd ..

### Configuring Google Maps API Key for Android
7. Add your Google Maps API key to the Android manifest:
    ```bash
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
        android:value="your_API_key"/>


### Building and Running the Android App
8. Connect your physical Android device to your computer with the debug option enabled, or start an emulator. Uninstall any previous versions of the app from your device.

9. Build and run the Android app:
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-android


### Components of the App
### Cards
SummaryCard: Used in ExploreScreen to display session history graph and statistics.<br>
<br>
CustomBtn: A button component created using Touchable, Text, and View components.<br>
<br>
WheelchairsView: Displays wheelchair information using a FlatList.

### Singleton Classes for Data Management
## Global Array Singleton
GlobalArraySingleton: Manages and passes session information throughout the app's pages.<br>
<br>
GlobalWheelchairSingleton: Manages and displays wheelchair information to all the app pages as needed.

### Services
## AsyncStorage Service
AsyncStorageService: Manages storage and retrieval of data such as tokens, login details, user information, data collection, session details, wheelchair data, and pre-post question information using the device's asynchronous storage.<br>
<br>
userAuthApi: Handles API endpoints for user authentication and data transfer to the server.
